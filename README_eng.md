# Python Projects

## Introduction
Welcome to **Python_Projects**, a repository where I gather all the projects I have developed throughout my journey in **Python**.

Each project is organized into directories according to its purpose and theme.

## Repository Structure

Currently, the repository contains the following main directory:

### [1. Python Zero to Hero: Master Coding with Real Projects](./Python_Zero_to_Hero-Master_Coding_with_Real_Projects/)
This directory groups projects developed during my Python training in the course [Python Zero to Hero: Master Coding with Real Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-project-masterclass/), following a hands-on approach based on real-world projects.

Within this directory, the projects are divided into:

- **[Non OOP Python Projects](./Python_Zero_to_Hero-Master_Coding_with_Real_Projects/non_oop_python_projects/)**:  
  Projects that follow a procedural approach without using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

- **[OOP Python Projects](./Python_Zero_to_Hero-Master_Coding_with_Real_Projects/OOP_python_projects/)**:  
  Projects that apply Object-Oriented Programming principles to enhance code modularity and reusability.  

### [2. Mastering Python for Bioinformatics](./Mastering_Python_for_Bioinformatics/)
This directory groups the projects developed during my reading of the book [Mastering Python for Bioinformatics](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-python-for/9781098100872/). This book guides the reader through 14 challenges on Rosalind, a platform dedicated to solving problems for learning bioinformatics and programming.

In the book, you learn how to leverage the best parts of Python to solve biological problems while creating documented, tested, and reproducible software. It not only teaches you how to write effective Python code but also demonstrates how to use tests to efficiently write and refactor scientific programs.

Within this directory, the projects are divided into:

- **[Rosalind Challenges Projects](./Mastering_Python_for_Bioinformatics/Rosalind_Challenges_Projects/)**:  
  Projects developed to tackle the 14 challenges on Rosalind.  

- **[Other Programs](./Mastering_Python_for_Bioinformatics/Other_Programs/)**:  
  Programs outside Rosalind covered in the book.
